# myseliasan

`myseliasan` is a relying control-plane app for `mymatasan`.

It has no public landing page. Opening `/` requires a valid local `myseliasan` session; unauthenticated users are redirected to MyIDSan through the authorization-code flow.

It communicates with `mymatasan` nodes directly over the LAN using the pairing protocol — no traffic is relayed through `myidsan`. A shared fleet key (PSK) authenticates UDP multicast discovery and HTTPS adoption; after adoption, ongoing management runs over mutual TLS using certificates issued by a self-contained on-prem fleet CA hosted here. `myidsan` is used for operator login only.

## Node management

The **Mymatasan** view in the UI exposes:

- **Fleet key**: generate or set the shared PSK (`POST /api/nodes/fleet-key`). Both the control plane and every node must have the same key for discovery to work.
- **LAN scan**: discover unpaired nodes on the local subnet (`POST /api/nodes/scan`); each result shows whether the node is already adopted.
- **Adopt**: provide the node IP, HTTPS port, and the claim code generated on the node UI to bind it (`POST /api/nodes/adopt`). After adoption, the node automatically contacts `POST /api/nodes/enroll` with a CSR; the control plane signs it and returns a short-lived certificate (default 7 days).
- **Adopted nodes**: table showing all adopted nodes with their status (`online`, `lost`, `self-dropped`), cert expiry, and a **Release** button. Release revokes the node's certificate and removes the registry row.
- **Heartbeat**: the control plane probes every adopted node over mTLS (`GET :<mtlsPort>/heartbeat`) on a configurable interval (default 60 s) and marks each node `online` or `lost`.

Both app and node must be on the same LAN segment for UDP multicast discovery to reach the node. Manual adoption by IP+port works across subnets if the node is reachable by HTTPS. The mTLS management port (default 49532) must also be reachable from the control plane.

## Fleet CA

`myseliasan` is its own on-prem certificate authority (ECDSA P-256, 10-year root). The CA key is stored in the local `ControlSetting` table (`pairing.caCert`/`pairing.caKey`) and is never transmitted off-prem. Node private keys are generated on the node and never sent to the control plane — only a CSR crosses the wire. Revocation is "refuse to renew + short TTL" (no CRL/OCSP). The `ManagedNode.Fingerprint` field is reserved for future use; identity is currently verified through the certificate CN.

## Frontend

The UI is a React/webpack SPA under `apps/myseliasan/views/react-webpack/`, built into `apps/myseliasan/static/` (content-hashed bundles), mirroring `mymatasan`'s frontend architecture. It reuses `mymatasan`'s `app.css` and `icons.js` verbatim; myseliasan-only styling lives in `styles/controlplane.css`. Build with `npm install && npm run build` in that directory.

Because the control plane authenticates with the federated middleware, **state-changing API calls must send the double-submit CSRF token**: the `api()` helper in `lib/helpers.js` echoes the non-HttpOnly `__Host-kopiv2_csrf` (HTTPS) / `kopiv2_csrf` (dev) cookie in the `X-CSRF-Token` header on POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE. Omitting it yields a 403 (which redirects to the SSO login). The fleet-key card includes a copy-to-clipboard button to avoid copy errors.

## Networking / operations

- Discovery is UDP multicast (group `239.255.90.21:49531` by default) sent and received on **all** multicast-capable interfaces, so multi-homed hosts and same-host dev work. The host firewall must allow inbound UDP on the discovery port (49531) and TCP on the mTLS management port (49532).
- Docker's default bridge network does not forward multicast — run with host networking, or use manual adoption by IP+port (which needs no multicast).
- Discovery is same-subnet only (UDP multicast does not route); manual adoption works across subnets as long as the node's HTTPS + mTLS ports are reachable.

## Development defaults

- App URL: `https://localhost:3002`
- MyIDSan provider URL: `https://localhost:3001`
- Client ID: `myseliasan`
- Dev client secret: `dev-myseliasan-secret`
- Callback URL registered in MyIDSan: `https://localhost:3002/api/auth/callback`
- `sso.redirectBaseUrl` controls the callback origin sent to MyIDSan; it must match a registered MyIDSan redirect URI.
- Local HTTPS requires certificates signed by a CA trusted by the machine running MySeliaSan, because MySeliaSan exchanges callback codes with MyIDSan over HTTPS from the backend.
- `sso.caCertPath` can point to a PEM CA/certificate bundle for that backend call; relative paths resolve from `apps/myseliasan`.
- The default dev value points to `../myidsan/certs/cert.pem`, which trusts the bundled localhost MyIDSan certificate. If you later replace MyIDSan with a privately signed certificate, point `sso.caCertPath` or `SSO_CA_CERT_PATH` at that CA bundle.
- `sso.caCertPath` only adds trusted roots for the backend HTTPS token exchange. It does not skip hostname, expiry, or chain validation.
- DB engine: SQLite at `apps/myseliasan/data/myseliasan.db`

Run MyIDSan first, then run:

```bash
ENVIRONMENT=dev JWT_SECRET=replace-with-strong-secret go run . -app myseliasan
```
